        <p>The Paleozoic (meaning "time of ancient life)" Era lasted from 544 to 245 million years ago, and is divided into six periods. These 300 million years of the Paleozoic era realized many critical events in evolution, including the development of most invertebrate groups, life's conquest of land, the evolution of fish, reptiles, insects, and vascular plants, the formation of the supercontinent of Pangea. Fish and fish-like vertebrates arose in the early Paleoozoic and comprise more than half of the diversity of vertebrates that inhabit the world today. Also importantly, there were also no less than two ice ages in the Paleozoic. The Paleozoic was ended by the greatest mass extinction event in geologic history, the Permian/Triassic extinction, when some 95% of all marine species met extincttion.</p>
			<h2><a name="#cambrian">Cambrian Explosion</a></h2>
        	<p>The name Cambrian derives from Cambria, the Roman name for Wales, where rocks of this age were first studied. Hard-shelled animals appeared in great numbers for the first time during the Cambrian, significantly because shallow seas flooded the continents. Gondwana formed near the South Pole.</p>
        	<p>The Cambrian truly is an astonishing period in evolution of life on earth. Most major groups of animals first appear in the fossil record, an event popularly and scientifically called the "Cambrian Explosion". The name largely derives from the hypothesized explosion of diversity of life that occurred very rapidly, but that this actually occurred is not a consensus among scientists. Darwin and others once believed that the Cambrian rocks contained the first and oldest fossil animals. We now know that these occur in the earlier Vendian strata.</p>
        	<p>Many marine metazoans having mineralized exoskeletons flourish in the Cambrian, including sponges, corals, molluscs, echinoderms, bryozoans, brachiopods and arthropods. It is commonly believed that there were no organisms at the very base of Cambrian that had hard parts, either as an external skeleton or simply spicules. This is, however, remains in dispute. The first shelled metazoans that are characteristic of the Cambrian occur well after the earliest complex trace fossils. This suggests that hard parts evolved later. Hence, trilobites, archaeocyaths, and small shelly animals did not evolve before the middle part of the Early Cambrian. The evolution of shelled metazoans is reflected by the appearence of successively more advanced shelly fossils.</p>
        	<p>Trilobites dominate the Cambrian fossil record, and these arthropods actually attained their peak number of families near the end of the Cambrian. It is believed there were some 15,000 species that evolved during the Paleozoic. Hence, the Paleozoic is sometimes called the age of trilobites. Modern times are sometimes called the age of insects (that are also arthropods), and it is believed there may be some 10,000,000 species of insects on Earth today (with beetles predominating).</p>
        	<p>The first detailed record of vertebrates appears during the Cambrian as fossils of jawless fish. These bottom-dwellers, some of which had skeletons made of cartilage rather than bone, first appeared some 500 million years ago. Many were covered in plate-like armour.</p>
        	<p>When one thinks of the migration of animals from the marine environment to land, Devonian-time comes to mind. But, in fact, the fossil record has substantial evidence that this critical adaptation had already begun in the Cambrian. One of these fossils, Climactichnites is almost as enigmatic today as it was during the time of Darwin.</p>
